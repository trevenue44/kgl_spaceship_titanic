# Spaceship Titanic
I went to [kaggle](https://kaggle.com/) recently and found this beginner competition on classification and I decided to try it out; my first official practice of Machine learning on data without actually following a tutorial or anything of the sort.

In this repository I document my process of ending up with a kaggle submision score (accuracy) of 0.79541.

Overall, I'd say it went pretty well.

I tried the same problem twice:
- [trial_1](./trial_1/)
- [trial_2](./trial_2/)

I'd say trial one is not as organised as the second trial in which I better combined sklearn transformers using pipelines and structured the model well. 

I learnt a great deal about working with pipelines whiles doing this particular trial of the spaceship titanic project.

Yes, I still believe there's still room for improvement on this accuracy.

Feel free to tweet to me or DM me [trevenue44](https://twitter.com/trevenue44) on any error or improvements you think I should implement. Looking forward to learning and improving on this.
